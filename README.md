# Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Project-In-Person-Attendance-Tracking System
## Project Goal and Purpose
This python project was developed to track class attendance for the SAT 4650 classes. Graduate class flexibility to attend may shelter lack of motivation or burnout, poor mental health and lack of accountability. While autonomy is respected, tracking attendance will help faculty and advisors to identify patterns that may indicate either student flexibility or a call for support. 

## Standard Python Library Modules used
🗄️ MySQL – used to connect to and interact with MySQL databases for storing and retrieving student attendance data.

📑 CSV – Python’s built-in module for reading from and writing to CSV (comma-separated values) files.

📅 Datetime – for handling dates, times, and timestamp operations.

📊 Matplotlib – a visualization library for creating charts and graphs to represent data visually.

🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – organizes code into classes and objects that are reusable and easy to maintain.

🗂️ Data Visualization – represents data in graphical formats for easier interpretation.

## Project Code Forkflow
📋 Create Student Table

Contains the student name, MTU email address, and ID number for all students in the SAT 4650 class.

🗂️ Create Attendance Table

Records class attendance on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Attendance roll call is entered as students check in for class each day.

📑 Export to CSV

Attendance data is exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

📊 Visualize Attendance

The CSV file is used to generate graphical visualizations of attendance patterns for each class day of the week.

## Project Application and Long-Term Goals
### Educational Context
🎓 Class Design & Models – this project can support the evolution of class structures and models by analyzing attendance status.

📊 Performance Integration – academic departments can integrate attendance data with student performance metrics for deeper insights.

🧑‍🎓 Student-Centered Programs – helps in developing programs that balance flexibility, quality, and accountability while ensuring students meet both institutional and external requirements.
### Application in the Health Setting
🏥 Patient Attendance Tracking – helps reveal causes of poor engagement, barriers to access, and can aid in predicting patient conditions and tailoring the righ interventions in high risk patients.

👩‍⚕️ Care Delivery Models – attendance patterns in certain populations can guide outreach clinics and mobile health programs.
