# Introduction-to-Python-Programming-Project-In-Person-Attendance-Tracking System
## Project Goal and Purpose
This python project was developed to track class attendance for the SAT 4650 classes. Graduate class flexibility to attend may shelter lack of motivation or burnout, poor mental health and lack of accountability. While autonomy is respected, tracking attendance will help faculty and advisors to identify patterns that may indicate either student flexibility or a call for support.
